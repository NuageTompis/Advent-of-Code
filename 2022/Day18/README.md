# Day 18

The first part was fairly simple, it only took me a few minutes

I found the second part however to be particularly interesting.
I followed multiple approaches that I describe in the heading of scripts, in the following order :
  - Day18Part2
  - Day18Part2Better
  - Day18Part2Final

I really enjoyed this problem and the way I improved my methods.
The time each script takes on my machine is :
  - Day18Part2 : 14min25s
  - Day18Part2Better : 4min35s
  - Day18Part2Final : 370ms
