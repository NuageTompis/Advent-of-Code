# [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

# Welcome !

This is my repository gathering my solutions for the 2022 AoC problems. I had already made a few problems from year 2019 but this is my first time completing a entire AoC.

Some explanation for each problem can be found at the beginning of each script. If further explanations are required however, the scripts can have they separate folder and their own README markdown.

Even though some scripts were pushed after the 25th, all solutions were done earlier than December 26th.

# Day 1

Nothing to declare

# Day 2

Basic algorithm, I treated the problem on a case-by-case basis

# Day 3

Not so smart algorithm neither, I coded the first idea that came to my mind but the solution could be faster. Also this is the first day in which I implemented a timer, it prints out the time spent executing in milliseconds

# Day 4

Fairly simple problem, plus I only had to change 2 characters to solve Part 2

# Day 5

I simulated the whole situation as the problem suggests

# Day 6

I wrote a simple script for Part 1, but a smarter one for Part 2, I enjoyed this last part because I find my solution more interesting than any previous problem

# Day 7

A beautiful problem, which I guess is very common to developpers. I implemented a Tree class which helped a lot

# Day 8

An interesting problem in my opinion. However I had to make a function for each direction and don't find that very pretty

# Day 9

As I did a lot during the Event, I worked here on a case-by-case basis, using many if statements. This made the solution fairly easy for both parts, but I will try to avoid this in the future

# Day 10

This problem was amusing to me because I worked with the Assembly language recently and the problem made me think of it.
The problem was fairly easy to solve, but I didn't make a general solution for Part 2 since I could not find all letter patterns on reddit. My code prints out the solution pattern in a file called Day10Output.txt

# Day 11

A very intruiging and funny problem. I worked with a list of objects representing the monkeys and simulated the situation

# Day 12

This was my first time working with an A\* algorithm. I already knew about this concept since I follow an amazing youtuber called Sebastian Lague.
You may find the video that inspired my solution at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L-WgKMFuhE&t=324s&fbclid=IwAR0m110tc3tvX0-K75wOzhPK6rF2p75KMkxPP7LFB6qdzzYXivczX87zHp0
For Part 2 I did the same process but the other way around
The only issue I encoutered is that I misread the problem : I thought that from the start the guy could only reach an 'a' cell, and that the end could only be reached from a 'z' cell. This made me waste half a day of debugging for no reason

# Day 13

A friend of mine taught me about the JSON.parse method afterwards which would have been very helpful. I updated my code with a JSON parse later that day.
To solve the problem I recursively compare each list pair

# Day 14

I found this problem to be fairly elegant. However my solution isn't the most beautiful since I create a grid pf fixed length using the boundaries of the map

# Day 15

An interesting problem today. I know there are smarter approaches than mine but I personnaly find my solution elegant
See the README of Day 15 for more commentary.

# Day 16

See the README of Day 16 for my commentary

# Day 17

A stimulating problem. It was the first I had to find a cycle to solve an angorithmic problem
See the README of Day 17 for more commentary

# Day 18

I was thrilled to tackle this problem and I am quite proud of my approach.
Make sure to read the README of Day 18 and execute the final version of my solution

# Day 19

# Day 20

I found this problem quite easy but appealing. I recomment reading the heading of each script to fond out how I tackled the problem

# Day 21

An interesting problem today aswell. I am quite proud of my approach and recommend reading my explanations at the beginning of both scripts.
Also please read the README of Day 21 for more commentary

# Day 22

The first part of this problem was interesting to me since I had never working on something like this. Part 2 however was very annoying. I couldn't figure out an easy way to solve the problem without folding the cube side by side.
Besides that the concept of the problem was quite amusing

# Day 23

For this problem I simulated the experience step by step. Nevertheless, I could optimize my script a lot. Also my code is quite long and not very clear thus I am not proud of my solution

# Day 24

A nice problem. I recursively try to find the fastest way, although in order to make my code work I have to set an upper bound for the amount of steps : if the elf can't reach the end fast enough, we re-try everything with a higher upper bound
I am quite frankly not proud of my solution, but I found better and more interesting approaches on reddit (and also way simpler)

# Day 25

An easier problem that the others, yet it still required some thinking. I implemented a function to code a message, and other one to decode it. The first one was simple but the second not so much.
Anyways it felt good to finally be over the 2022 AoC event because I really needed some rest

# Conclusion

I was very eager to start the event because I truly love coding, problem-solving and competition. During the first two weeks, I woke up (almost) every day at 6am to start the daily problem at soon as it went live.
I was learning JavaScript so I spend quite a lot of time on the official documentation but still managed to solve the problems in decent time in my opinion.

I stopped waking up so early when the problems became a bit long to solve to me, and the holidays started around at that moment. I kept coding everyday however, despite my dire need to rest.
I sincerely enjoyed most of the problems, my only regret being that the event took place during the Christmas holidays and thus I didn't really have any time to rest, not only because I had to code for hours every day but also because I had some work to do for other courses.
