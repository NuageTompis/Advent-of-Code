## [Advent of Code 2022] (https://adventofcode.com/2022)

# Welcome !

This is my repository gathering my solutions for the 2022 AoC problems. I had already made a few problems from year 2019 but this is my first time completing a entire AoC.

The explanations for each code can be found at the beginning of each script. If further explanations are required however, the scripts can have they separate folder and their own README markdown.

Even though some scripts were pushed after the 25th, all solutions were done earlier than December 26th.
