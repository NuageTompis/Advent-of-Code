**Hello there!**

Here are my solutions for the AoC 2023 problems. I've opted for Rust this time,  an intriguing language I'm just starting to get familiar.

**Usage:** *For Windows only*
- _Paste your input inside_ ***input.txt***
- Run: ```make run n``` for day n, part 1, or ```make run np2``` for part 2.
- Use ```make clear``` if you want to delete the generated executables
